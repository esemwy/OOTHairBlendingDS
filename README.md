Outoftouch has produced a number of hair props for Poser/DAZ Studio that include a "HairBlending" feature.
As released, this feature is automated only in Poser Python. This script reimplements that functionality in
DAZScript.

HairBlending works on any hair with a vertically oriented UV and straight strips. Simply select all the hair
materials in the Surfaces tab that you wish to blend, then launch the script. Choose, from top to bottom,
a "Base", a "Layer", and a "Mask, the *Do It*. HairBlending will use the L.I.E. to create your hair texture.
The script, and OOT Hair Blending in general, should be renderer agnostic as it only edits the diffuse channel.
